Neural Network Java Implementation
input file formaat is as following :

1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0//this is input

0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0//this is output

1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0//this is input

0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0//this is output

...
...
...

program reads the file line by line 

and then executes the training method.

After training you can save the object with serializable interface. and use the trained network for later .
